**Abbreviation**: *IntelliPM*

### 🔍 Problem Statement

* Managing portfolios of projects
* Tracking performance, risks, and team mood
* Generating AI-based summaries & documents
* Simulating PM decision-making

This web/app is intended for internal company use, with no payment or billing integration involved.
